# Basic NLP methods for reference
Repository for basic applied NLP tasks for an introduction to:
1. [NLTK notes](<./NLTK Notes.ipynb>): Basic NLTK reference, containing excerpts from the [NLTK book](https://www.nltk.org/book/)
2. [NLTK - Comparing pronoun and modal verb language use](<./NLTK - Comparing pronoun and modal verb language use.ipynb>): Basic codes for counting pronoun and modal verb usage in text, and how to use NLTK to do this faster.
3. [Zipf's Law](<./Understanding Zipfs Law.ipynb>): Zipf's law states that given a large sample of words used, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. So word number n has a frequency proportional to 1/n. This file explores this empirical law practically.
4. [Analogy Prediction](<./Analogy Prediction using gensim, word2vec and glove.ipynb>): Using pre-trained word vectors for predicting analogies between word pairs based on relations.
5. [Language Model for machine translation between English, French, Italian and Spanish](<./Language Model for machine translation between English, French, Italian and Spanish.ipynb>): Building a crude character level bigram language model to perform translation between languages such as English, French, Italian and Spanish.
